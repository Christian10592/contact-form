## Material Design Contact Form

A simple easy to use **Contact Form**. Developed using Pug, Jquery, and SCSS.

## Demo

[View Demo Here!](http://christiansmitherman.com/#contact)

In production I'm using [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) to send the form.

## Notes

 - **HTML:** Since I'm using [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) as my view engine. **index.html** is minified.

 - **Validation:** Super basic form validation. Only checks if input's length is longer than 1 and if email input has '@' and '.'
